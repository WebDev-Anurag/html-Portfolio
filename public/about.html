<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hello there! This is Anurag. I'm a Student at SUIIT, Burla, an Engineering college in Western Odisha.
   I am pursuing Btech in CSE and aspire to be a  Web developer. I am resident of Bhubaneswar and have completed 
   my Board Exams from Kendriya Vidyalaya No.1, Bhubaneswar.</p>

<p>I have currently started my journey to become a Web developer by enrolling myself in a course by Udemy.
  I have worked on some projects and have provided the links to visit those above. You can check them out by clicking on the 
  headings of projects at the home page which are links to the projects.
</p>

<p>I am going to add a feedback box to the home page in the near future so that you could write your experience and tips about my 
  projects and website. Keep visiting this page for future updates. Have a good day!
